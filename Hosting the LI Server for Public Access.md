# Why

When the LI server is empty, you can only join the server from the Steam Group Servers list. In order to open the server to the public so new players can join, you will have to "start" a lobby using the steam group server which (I assume) registers the server in steam's public listing and allows players to join through quick play (if the difficulty is on normal).

This requires the server to be empty, so if there are players that have joined through the group server list then they will have to voluntarily leave and rejoin.

# Requirements

I like to use the 8 player lobby mod from the workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2276071285

You will also likely have to join the Lethal Injection group to see the server from the Steam Group Server list (if you haven't already)

# Step 1/Changing Mutations

The 8 player lobby mod works as a mutation, so we will have to set up a mutation lobby to set up the server.

# Step 2/Creating the Lobby

In order to create the lobby, I like to go through "Play With Friends" -> "Create New (...) Lobby" which will create a Friends-only lobby so nobody can join while I fiddle with the settings. 

On the 8 Player Lobby Settings page, make sure the "Server Type" is set to "Steam Group Server"

# Step 3/Lobby Setup

As it is now, if you were to try starting the server it will not work because of some funky interaction between the 8 player lobby mod and the game. In "Edit Game Settings" you will have to change the mode to "Campaign"

# Step 4/Starting the Lobby

Be sure to set the permissions to public before you start or else nobody will be able to join. The "Enable Microphone" button has been replaced by the mod as the "Start the Game" button, which can be misleading so I've outlined it below.
